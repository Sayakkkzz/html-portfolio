<h5>La La Land has to be one of the best films I've ever watched.<br/ >
La La Land is a film you simply never want to stop watching.<br />
 It has wisdom and joy and sadness and such magic, from the evocative

        <h5>'Some infinities are bigger than other infinities' 
            says my favorite quote from the movie (and the book) and its true 
            because I am going to love this movie for the longest of the infinity.
            It was funny and certainly heart gripping.</h5>

    <h5> A wonderfully written story, played by such talented actors.
         The little details that make it just that little bit more intense.
         The right expressions that make it just that little bit more 
        touching. The right words that make just that much of a difference.</h5>
